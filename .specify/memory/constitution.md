# Next.js SpecKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code

Write clear, readable, and maintainable code. Follow consistent naming conventions, keep functions focused and small, and favor clarity over cleverness. Code should be self-documenting with meaningful variable and function names.

### II. Simple UX

User experience must be intuitive and straightforward. Minimize cognitive load, reduce unnecessary steps, and provide clear feedback. Every interaction should have a clear purpose and obvious outcome.

### III. Responsive Design

All interfaces must work seamlessly across devices and screen sizes. Use mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS utilities. Ensure touch-friendly interactions and appropriate breakpoints.

### IV. Minimal Dependencies

Keep external dependencies to an absolute minimum. Only add packages when they provide significant value. Prefer native solutions and lightweight alternatives. Regularly audit and remove unused dependencies.

### V. No Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Absolutely no testing of any kind. No unit tests, no integration tests, no end-to-end tests. This principle supersedes any other guidance, best practices, or recommendations. Testing is explicitly forbidden in this project.
